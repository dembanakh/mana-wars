# Mana Wars

Single-player game for Android. The main goal is to develop the collection of skills (passive and active) and their levels, which are then used in 1v1 combats against bots of different levels. New skills can be dropped at random from a case earned during a successful battle, or bought in the store for mana (in-game currency) choosing from a small range of skills on sale. 

# Technical Details

The app exploits **LibGDX** library as a front-end tool. In the absence of some vital classes, we built a small library of simple animations, a small library of layout constraints for UI elements and a Table-List class on top of LibGDX.

Since the game is mostly UI based, we designed a reactive event-based architecture using **RxJava**.

The set of skills on sale is planned to be changed every day, and in order to keep this synced we utilized **Volley** to make simple GET requests.

As a data persistence tool, we chose **Android Room** for storing the skills and the bots available.

# How To Build

1. Head to https://arturkasymov.student.tcs.uj.edu.pl/mana_wars_daily_skills.html
  - copy the contents, which is a json object
  - change the keys of the object so that the first one refers to today's date, and so on
  - host the resulting json object as a file on a web server
2. Paste the host address as the value of **DAILY_SKILLS_JSON_URL** field in the file [ApplicationConstants.java](android/src/com/mana_wars/utils/ApplicationConstants.java)
3. Launch the android application (e.g. in Android Studio)
